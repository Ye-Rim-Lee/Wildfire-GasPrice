## Highlights
-	We examine the impact of the 2024 Park Fire in California on local gasoline prices.
-	Our analysis includes station-level gas prices, weather information, road closures, distance to the event (edge of fire or closed road) and unaffected (control) stations outside the fire area. 
-	We find a decline in gas prices in the affected area during the fire period.


## Abstract 

As wildfires become increasingly frequent and intense due to multiple factors such as a changing climate and the accumulation of dry vegetation , understanding their economic effects on critical commodities is essential to evaluate their economic consequences beyond immediate property damage. This study assesses the short-term impact of the 2024 Park Fire on local retail gasoline prices in Northern California, using high-frequency station-level data. A generalized difference-in-differences approach and event study reveal that stations within 20 miles of the wildfire experienced a roughly nine-cent-per-gallon price drop compared to more distant controls—an outcome contrasting with the price spikes typically observed after hurricanes and floods. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how natural disasters, particularly wildfires, can influence fuel markets in unexpected ways, highlighting the importance of monitoring post-disaster price changes.

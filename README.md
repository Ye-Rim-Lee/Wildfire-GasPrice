## 📑 Abstract
As wildfires become more frequent and intense due to factors such as climate change and dry vegetation accumulation, assessing their economic impact on critical commodities is essential. This study examines the short-term effects of the 2024 Park Fire on local retail gasoline prices in Northern California using **high-frequency station-level data**. 

Applying a **generalized difference-in-differences** approach and event study analysis, we find that gas stations within **20 miles of the wildfire** experienced an average **nine-cent-per-gallon price drop** compared to more distant control stations. This outcome contrasts with the **price spikes** typically observed following hurricanes and floods. 

Our findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating how natural disasters—particularly wildfires—can shape fuel market dynamics in unexpected ways. These insights emphasize the need for **post-disaster price monitoring** and market resilience strategies.
